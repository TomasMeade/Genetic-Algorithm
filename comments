A: Nice job overall. A few limitations noted below.

## ease of accessing package, help, tests:

Good.

## main help page (select):

Good description of arguments and output. No description of algorithm used.
A couple simulated examples, one somewhat large.

## quality of user interface (function arguments, flexibility):

Various user options. Good use of a default for population size.
Not clear to me how objective_fun works, given that in eval_fit(), you don't pass the data into the function.

## performance on my tests:

performance on baseball known: good - found best model
performance on baseball full: good - found a competitive model though not as good as best I found
performance on big-p: ok, but not particularly close to the true model.

## testing

Tests pass.

Good set of tests: Various unit tests of correctness. Overall tests of performance on datasets. Testing that all true predictors are in the found model seems asymmetric - would be good to also report if your algorithm found the true model and, if not, how far away the true model is in terms of AIC.

## writeup (including examples):

Clear. Good description of examples, though would have been nice to have a real data example.

## code efficiency

Seems good for small cases. Slow for my large test case.

## code organization/clarity/elegance:

Good - easy to follow, fairly concise.

Should be able to vectorize select_parents to avoid the loop in there.

## code comments/formatting:

Good.

## parallelization:

None

## equality of workload:

Fine, though it seems a bit imbalanced.
